# StringMatching
This repository includes implementation in Python of 2 algorithms for exact string matching.

One of them is the Z algorithm, the other one is Knuth Morris Pratt. Both run in liniar time.
Both of them are implemented in their optimal form, as they do the minimum necessary computations. 
Please find in the output directory some examples
